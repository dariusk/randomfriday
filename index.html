    <h2>Random Friday</h2>
    Limited edition shipments of Random Shopper. For the holidays.
  </div></section>
    <section id="welcome"><div class="inner"><h3>29 Nov, 2013</h3>It’s Black Friday, the sale that heralds the holiday season. Perhaps you’re eyeing some designer clothing, a fancy new videogame console, or a stand mixer for your kitchen.</div></section>
    <section id="maybe"><div class="inner">But maybe it doesn’t matter what you buy. Maybe it’s the act of buying that’s what’s important.</div></section>
    <section id="history"><div class="inner"><a href="http://randomshopper.tumblr.com/post/35454415921/randomized-consumerism">Random Shopper</a> was a project I ran a year ago. I wrote a computer program that spent $50 each month buying and sending me random books, CDs, and DVDs from Amazon. I sure did get <a href="http://randomshopper.tumblr.com/tagged/shipment">a lot of random stuff</a>.</div></section>
    <section id="play"><div class="inner">Now you too can play Russian roulette with your consumerist instincts.</div></section>
    <section class="end"><div class="inner"><h3>Buy a Print</h3>I am offering 50 limited edition “prints” of the Random Shopper project. Each print costs $400. I will run the Random Shopper algorithm with an address of your choice instead of my own, and a single purchase of random stuff will be sent to that address.</div></section>
    <section class="end"><div class="inner">It’s the perfect gift for that certain someone in your life who, when asked what they want for the holidays, responded, “A trenchant critique of consumer culture.”</div></section>
    <section class="end"><div class="inner">You’ll get:
    <ul>
      <li>$100 (give or take a few bucks) worth of random books, CDs, and DVDs sent to the mainland United States address of your choice, operating on the original Random Shopper algorithm. (The algorithm guarantees at least two items, and you may get many more.)</li>
      <li>A numbered certificate, ink-signed by me, along with a list of the shipped items chosen by the algorithm. This comes in a separate shipment, and the list of items will be physically obscured so as not to spoil the surprise.</li>
      <li>An email from me with estimated arrival dates for your shipment(s) (there may be more than one shipment).</li>
    </ul>
    </div></section>
    <section class="end"><div class="inner">This is a limited time offer, available between now and Jan 1, 2014. Happy holidays.<br><br>&mdash;Darius Kazemi</div></section>
