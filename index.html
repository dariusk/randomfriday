    <h2>Random Friday</h2>
    <h3>by Darius Kazemi</h3>
    <p><em>29 Nov, 2013</em> &mdash; It’s Black Friday, the sale that heralds the holiday season. Perhaps you’re eyeing some designer clothing, a fancy new videogame console, or a stand mixer for your kitchen.</p>
    <p>But maybe it doesn’t matter what you buy. Maybe it’s the act of buying that’s what’s important.</p>
    <p><a href="http://randomshopper.tumblr.com/post/35454415921/randomized-consumerism">Random Shopper</a> was a project I ran a year ago. I wrote a computer program that spent $50 each month buying and sending me random books, CDs, and DVDs from Amazon. I sure did get <a href="http://randomshopper.tumblr.com/tagged/shipment">a lot of random stuff</a>.</p>
    <p>Now you too can play Russian roulette with your consumerist instincts.</p>
    <p>I am offering 50 limited edition “prints” of the Random Shopper project. Each print costs $400. I will run the Random Shopper algorithm with an address of your choice instead of my own, and a single purchase of random stuff will be sent to that address.</p>
    <p>It’s the perfect gift for that certain someone in your life who, when asked what they want for the holidays, responded, “A trenchant critique of consumer culture.”</p>
    <p>You’ll get:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>$100 (give or take a few bucks) worth of random books, CDs, and DVDs sent to the mainland United States address of your choice, operating on the original Random Shopper algorithm. (The algorithm guarantees at least two items, and you may get many more.)</li>
      <li>A certificate, signed by me, containing the number of the print, along with a list of the shipped items chosen by the algorithm. This comes in a separate shipment, and the list of items will be physically obscured so as not to spoil the surprise.</li>
      <li>An email from me with estimated arrival dates for your shipment(s) (there may be more than one shipment).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is a limited time offer, available between now and Jan 1, 2014. Happy holidays.</p>
